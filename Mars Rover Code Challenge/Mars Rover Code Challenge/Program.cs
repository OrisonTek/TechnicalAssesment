            Rovers have been sent to Mars to survey the terrain and you have been charged with creating their navigation system.
            The specifications of the challenge are listed below.
            
            ● Mars’s surface can be thought of as a zone that is itself a two-dimensional grid of square areas. 
            
            ● The zones have been very carefully surveyed ahead of time and are deemed safe for exploration within the landing terrain bounds, as represented by a single cartesian coordinate - for example: (5, 5). 
            
            ● The rover understands the cardinal points and can face either East (E), West (W), North (N) or South (S) at any given time. 
            
            ● The rover understands three commands: 
            
            ○ M - Move one space forward in the direction it is facing ,  ○ R - rotate 90 degrees to the right , ○ L - rotate 90 degrees to the left
            
            ● Due to the transmission delay in communicating with the rover on Mars, 
            you are only able to send the rover a single list of commands.
            
            ● These commands will be executed by the rover and its resulting location sent back to HQ. 
            
            This is an example of the list of commands sent to the rover: 
             8 10 12 E MMLMRMMRRMML 
            
            ● This is how the rover will interpret the above commands: ○ The first line describes how big the current zone is. This zone’s boundary is at the Cartesian coordinate of 8,10 and the zone comprises 80 blocks. 
            
            ○ The second line describes the rover’s starting location and orientation. ○ This rover would start at position 1 on the horizontal axis, position 2 on the vertical axis and would be facing East (E).
            The third line is the list of commands (movements and rotations) to be executed by the rover. ○ As a result of following these commands, a rover starting at ​1 2 E in this zone would land up at ​3 3 S
​              
You are to design a program which takes a text in the format as described above and then displays its resulting rover location to the console. Be sure to include: 
           
            ● A README with clear instructions on how to use your program.
           Also include a brief description of the design decisions made in your program as well as how you have ensured your code’s correctness. 
           
            ● The input to your program (as described above) as well as any additional inputs.
